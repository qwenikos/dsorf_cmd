Introduction
---------------------------------------------------------------------
D-sORF is an alignment-free data mining algorithm based on machine learning.
The algorithm is based on the nucleotide composition of the ORF and the sequence
information around the ATG start codon, called translation initiation site (TIS)
. D-sORF distinguishes coding from non-coding transcripts and focuses on sequences
with small ORFs. Provides a scoring system for predicting putative translating
sORFs based on nucleotide context of three different windows (54 99 and 180-nts)
within ORFs and a 9-nts window around TIS of experimentally validated CDSs of
protein-coding genes compared to windows of similar size and location in negative
sORFs.

Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------
D-sORF is written in Python (version 2.7 and above required) and requires the following Modules

Bedtools suite is required and should be in the PATH. Bedtools can be found
in http://code.google.com/p/bedtools/.
